## Acknowledgements

-   This project was inspired by `Chess.JS` and `React-Chessboard`, those two libraries gave me possibility to create this app. Ofcourse there were plenty
    libraries that i used, but those two are directily taking care of chess aspect of this app which is the most important.
-   Beside chess libraries this project was based on `React JoyRide` which hold control about guide and whole user expierence during course.
